# Satellite-Drainage-Systems
Our goal here is to figure out the drainage detection channel  using satellite images. The satellite images have a lot of noise so we will have to thruoghly clean the image or atleast highlight the contours to do requried detection. So we use image processing techniques

The following process is followd


1.   Contrast streching using histogram equalizaiotn
2.   Then we highlight the edges further using edge enhancement techniques
3.   Next we do edge detection
4.   And lastly we use skeletalization
